## 📄 Project Overview

Dzeloq is a Transformer-based machine translation system designed for translating Algerian Arabic (Darija) into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Due to the scarcity of annotated resources and tools for Algerian Darija, this project focuses on building a large parallel dataset and fine-tuning multilingual transformer models to improve translation quality in low-resource settings.

We constructed a dataset of **149,061 parallel sentence pairs** collected from social media, traditional narratives, and synthetically generated data using large language models. Using state-of-the-art pretrained models such as **NLLB-200-600M** and **M2M100**, we fine-tuned these models under limited computational resources.

Evaluation using **BLEU** and **ChrF++** metrics demonstrates that Dzeloq achieves significant improvements and outperforms several well-known models, including GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Gemma2-9B, in both automatic and human evaluations.

This work highlights the effectiveness of fine-tuning multilingual transformers for underrepresented dialects and emphasizes the importance of localized NLP solutions.
